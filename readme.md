### 8/26/2023 - Course patch update including new module 7 on React Server Components 

## Course Description

Creating UIs in React is all about creating independent components that seamlessly work together to present a consistent view across your React web app. In this course, Working with React Components, you will gain the ability to architect and build high quality react apps. First, you will learn how the design principle separation of concerns applies to building React components. Next, you will discover the various primitive methods for sharing data and methods between components as well as sharing data more globally with the Context API. Finally, you will explore how you can improve your Apps performance taking advantage of Concurrent Rendering. When you are finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge of React component design needed to leverage re-usability and ensure consistency in your apps and code with less bugs.

## Getting Started
1. **Install [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)**.
2. **Clone this repository.** - `https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-working-with-components-in-react18` or [download the zip](https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-working-with-components-in-react18/archive/master.zip)
3. **Set your default directory to which module you want (example: `cd m4` - `cd m4-clip-040`
4. **Install Node Packages with Dependencies.** - `npm install`



## Directory Structure Here

Each of the folders here represent one module of the course.  In each folder, there are subfolders that represent the completed code at the end of each clip. Where this is no clip reference, either there is no code in that clip or nothing changed from the previous clip.

Once in a clip directory, the easiest way to test the app is to first install the packages by typing at the root of that directory (in a terminal window or DOS prompt)

`npm install`

Then, do run the app you just need type

`npm run dev`

That will launch the web server on port 3000 where you can browser to it at the url: `http://localhost:3000`
